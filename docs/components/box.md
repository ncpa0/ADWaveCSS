# Box

Box is a simple container element. By default comes with a flex display type.

```html
<div class="box">
  <!-- content -->
</div>
```

## Brighter box

Box elements when the `light` class name is assigned to them change their background color to a brighter one.

```html
<div class="box light">
  <!-- content -->
</div>
```

# Class Names

- `box` - a container element with a flex display type
- `light` - a class that should be added to the box element if it should have a brighter background color
