# Box

Box is a simple container element. By default comes with a flex display type.

```html
<div class="box">
  <!-- content -->
</div>
```

## Darker box

Box elements when the `dark` class name is assigned to them change their background color to a darker one.

```html
<div class="box dark">
  <!-- content -->
</div>
```
